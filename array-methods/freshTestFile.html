  NATIVE DESCRIPTION

  The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from begin to end (end not included) where begin and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.

  Syntax:

  arr.slice([begin[, end]])

  Parameters

  begin - Optional

  Zero-based index at which to begin extraction.
  A negative index can be used, indicating an offset from the end of the sequence. slice(-2) extracts the last two elements in the sequence.
  If begin is undefined, slice begins from index 0.
  If begin is greater than the length of the sequence, an empty array is returned.

  end - Optional

  Zero-based index before which to end extraction. slice extracts up to but not including end.
  For example, slice(1,4) extracts the second element through the fourth element (elements indexed 1, 2, and 3).
  A negative index can be used, indicating an offset from the end of the sequence. slice(2,-1) extracts the third element through the second-to-last element in the sequence.
  If end is omitted, slice extracts through the end of the sequence (arr.length).
  If end is greater than the length of the sequence, slice extracts through to the end of the sequence (arr.length).

  Return value

  A new array containing the extracted elements.

  REQUIREMENTS:

  If no begin, slice should start at index 0
  If begin, slice should start at index begins
  If begin is negative, it should start at the indicated offset from the end of the array.

  If begin is greater than length of sequence, an empty array is returned.

  If end, slice should extract up to, but not including index end.
  If end is negative, it should slice up to the offset from the end of the sequence.
  If end is greater than length of sequence, or end is omitted slice extracts through to the end of sequence (arr.length)
