NATIVE DESCRIPTION

The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.

Syntax

arr.pop()

Return value

The removed element from the array; undefined if the array is empty.

The pop method removes the last element from an array and returns that value to the caller.

pop is intentionally generic; this method can be called or applied to objects resembling arrays. Objects which do not contain a length property reflecting the last in a series of consecutive, zero-based numerical properties may not behave in any meaningful manner.

If you call pop() on an empty array, it returns undefined.

Array.prototype.shift() has similar behavior to pop, but applied to the first element in an array.

REQUIREMENTS:

It should remove the last element of an array.
It should return the element that was removed.
It should return undefined if called on an empty array.
  */
function pop(array) {
  if (array.length <= 0){
    return undefined;
  }
  let popped = array[array.length - 1];
  array.length--;
  return popped;
}

tests({
    'It should remove the last element of an array': function () {
      let testArray = [1, 2];
      pop(testArray);
      eq(testArray.length, 1);
      eq(testArray[0], 1);
    },
    'It should return the element that was removed': function () {
        let result = pop(['remove', 'me']);
        eq(result, 'me');
    },
    'It should return undefined if called on an empty array.': function () {
        let result = pop([]);
        eq(result, undefined);
    }
});
