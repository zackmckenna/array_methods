NATIVE DESCRIPTION

The shift() method removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element. This method changes the length of the array.

Syntax

arr.shift()

Return value

The removed element from the array; undefined if the array is empty.

The shift method removes the element at the zeroeth index and shifts the values at consecutive indexes down, then returns the removed value. If the length property is 0, undefined is returned.

shift is intentionally generic; this method can be called or applied to objects resembling arrays. Objects which do not contain a length property reflecting the last in a series of consecutive, zero-based numerical properties may not behave in any meaningful manner.

Array.prototype.pop() has similar behavior to shift, but applied to the last element in an array.

REQUIREMENTS:

It should remove the first element of an array.
It should return the element that was removed.
It should return undefined if called on an empty array.

function shift(array) {
  if (array.length <= 0){
    return undefined;
  }
  let removedElement = array[0];
  for (let i = 1; i < array.length; i++){
    array[i - 1] = array[i];
  }
  array.length--;
  return removedElement;
}

tests({
    'It should remove the first element of an array': function () {
      let testArray = [1, 2];
      shift(testArray);
      eq(testArray.length, 1);
      eq(testArray[0], 2);
    },
    'It should return the element that was removed': function () {
        let result = shift(['remove', 'me']);
        eq(result, 'remove');
    },
    'It should return undefined if called on an empty array.': function () {
        let result = shift([]);
        eq(result, undefined);
    }
});
